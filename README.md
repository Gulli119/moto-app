This repository contains the code for a motorcycle web scraping application i made in R to facilitate the process of finding a used bike in Italy (my home country)

This passion project emerged from a necessity, searching used bikes to buy, the traditional method of searching through multiple websites was too time-consuming. I aimed to address this problem to the best of my ability with my current knowledge. Although the project is still a work in progress, the ultimate goal is to publish it for public use and benefit. Notably, the framework is flexible and can be slightly modified for various other applications. While it may not be the fastest or most optimal solution, it is straightforward and easy to understand.
